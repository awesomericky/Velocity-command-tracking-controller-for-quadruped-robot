runner2.py : using multiple command sampler (constant command, uniform time correlated command, normal time correlated command)

point_goal_initialize:
- fixed center point + random orientation initialize  (to make the goal path lengh similar)
- goal equally sampled in four frames

CVAE_data_collection_initialize:
- fixed center point + random orientation initialize  (to make the goal path lengh similar)
- goal randomly sampled without considering the frame

CVAE_environment_evaluation_initialize
- random initialize
- goal randomly sampled without considering the frame

** Don't forget to check whether env.initialize_n_step() is called after the environment is done, because it will decide to initialize in different position or not.
