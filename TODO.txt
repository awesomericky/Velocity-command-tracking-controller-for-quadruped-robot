1. Add lidar noise to all folders except "lidar_model" (especially lidar_model_test"
2. Change "Command_sampler --> Time_correlated_command_sampler" if needed for MPPI planner

*Check
- 50/50 matching the collision/non-collision data --> erase it and run it because there could be overfitting
- larger beta(current: 0.1) for time correlated command sampling?
